//! # Introduction
//!
//! This library is designed to simplify students' and school's staff lives by removing the "tokens" in the Epitech school.
//!
//! A token is a piece of paper given to students with a number on it, used to verify their presence to a school event.
//!
//! Tokens have to be entered on the school's intranet.
//!
//! But tokens are often forgotten or lost, and for every event new tokens have to be printed.
//!
//! ## Warning
//!
//! This library will be useful only to people who are in possession of a privileged Epitech account (astek, aer, adm, pedago).
//! So if you are just an Epitech student, this library won't be helpful for you at all.
